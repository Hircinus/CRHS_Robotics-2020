       <h2>About the CRC Robotics</h2>
       <hr class="outer-divider">
       <p>
       The annual CRC Robotics competition was founded in 2001 by a group of professional athletes unhappy with the lack
       of robotics competitions available for high school and CEGEP students in Canada. The competition invites young
       new talented athletes from all around the country to show off their skills in the diverse fields of the
       competition. The competition is based around science, technology, engineering, mathematics, arts and languages.
       The three-day sports event is run by former participants with the goal of giving students the same experiences
       they received themselves.

     <p>
     Each team must design and construct a robot athlete capable of achieving the many tasks it must perform to compete
     against the opposing teams. The course and its many features vary every year. Over the span of three days, the
     athletes and their coaching staff are the center of all the attention with fans and cameras flooding from around
     the world as millions of people watch from home and on the stands as history unfolds.

     <h3>Program the robot</h3>

     <p>
     Without the programmers, our robot wouldnâ€™t be able to do much. The programming aspect of the competition is one of
     the most crucial parts of the competition. This section of the tournament is usually what makes or breaks a team.

     <p>
     Every great sports event needs a great broadcasting room. Therefore, teams are tasked with creating and designing a
     broadcasting room/kiosk. The kiosk must measure 12&apos; &times; 12&apos; and be themed according to the team's theme. The kiosk is
     also a good spot for the coaches and captains to plan out their strategy and next moves.

     Teams are tasked with creating a website from scratch with the intention of documenting the progress of the team as
     they move forward with the creation of the robotic athlete while still following the chosen theme. The website
     includes videos, pictures, articles, and much more.
