After much deliberation, the robot team finally decided on the drive system we will use for the robot! We looked at
different types of wheel systems, 4-wheel systems, 2 wheel systems, or using tank treads. This discussion also included
the type of wheels we would use for the system, such as wheels with castors, omni wheels and mecanum wheels. We made mini
prototypes of all of these systems to see what the best option would be.
<br>
In the end we came to the decision that a four wheel mecannum setup would be most beneficial considering how they allow
for a wide range of mobility, and is versatile in every way. Also, we have had previous experience with these wheels
before and understand itâ€™s speed limitations and because of these we will better be able to adapt our robot to
accommodate for the wheels lower speed. The other systems are either slower less versatile or we have less experience
working with them, and we wanted our drive system to be reliable.
<br>
Now that we have chosen the drive system, we are hard at work on making the system and making sure that it will be up
and running and working the best that it can be.
