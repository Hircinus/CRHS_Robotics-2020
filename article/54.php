The 2<sup>nd</sup> overall placed team from last year’s competition has released their final roster for FLIP 2020. This
year’s team includes a lot of new faces as a large core of the team from last year graduated last spring. To find new
team members a recruitment process took place. Sec 3’s and 4’s attended a presentation done by a team of veterans in each
category of the competition. Samir (Robot), Gabriella (Kiosk), Nicholas (Video) and Jacob (Website) all gave presentations that
wowed the students in attendance. The meeting was considered a success by our team head Barry Dobbs as 25 new faces
joined  the team for the season.

Although the losses from last season may team will be felt, I’m confident that the
newcomers will make their presence felt in the team. Although losing a large chunk of a team’s core would prove to be
detrimental to their odds of winning, Centennial is still considered  a contender to take home the championship this
season. With half the team made up of rookies it may be difficult to achieve their title hopes, the team is still very
determined to go all the way this season. This fresh crop of rookies could be what takes Centennial over the top into
championship territory.
